# Traditional Javascript Development 

The code in this repository is developed with plain simple html/css/js technologies owing to the fact that the app needs to be supported in the primitive Tizen browsers of the Samsung Smart TV

The video tags in the app are supported with Video-js Framework.

Deploy the application in a server and open its index.html file to test view the same.

If you dont have a server, then 
1. install NodeJS
2. navigate the the app root directory %application-deployment-path%
3. run the command "npm install connect serve-static" from the application deployment path
4. once that completes successfully, run the command "node server"
5. Open your browser and type the url "http://localhost:8080/index.html"
